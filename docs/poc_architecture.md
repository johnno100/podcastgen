# Proof of Concept Architecture: Multimodal Dialogue Podcast Generator

## Introduction

This document outlines a proof of concept architecture for a system that can take multimodal input content and create a multi-person dialogue-based podcast script with voice synthesis integration. The architecture is inspired by the capabilities observed in Monica.im and Google NotebookLM, combining the strengths of both approaches while maintaining flexibility and scalability.

## System Overview

The proposed system follows a modular pipeline architecture with the following high-level components:

1. **Content Ingestion Layer**: Handles various input types and prepares them for processing
2. **Content Understanding Layer**: Analyzes and extracts key information from inputs
3. **Dialogue Generation Layer**: Transforms structured content into natural conversations
4. **Voice Synthesis Layer**: Converts text dialogue into natural-sounding audio
5. **Delivery Layer**: Packages and delivers the final podcast

This modular approach allows for independent optimization of each component and easier integration of new technologies as they become available.
